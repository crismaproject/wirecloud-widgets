# Technical documentation

This is a small widget for development purposes *only*.

It consists of only one output endpoint that can be connected to any other widget's input endpoint. It is able to send string-based event data across these connections.
If the preference `to_console` is `true`, this data will *additionally* be sent to the browser's JavaScript console (view it with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+J` in Chrome).
