# Technical documentation

This is a small widget for development purposes *only*.

This widget does nothing more than removing specific elements from Wirecloud's DOM. The next time the window is
resized, your mashup application should fill the entire viewport. Note that *a.)* you are going to lose access
to menu items such as "Marketplace", "Wiring", or "Editor", and *b.)* you cannot undo this operation without
completely refreshing your entire window.
